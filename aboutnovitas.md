# New to the Freelands?


<p class="drop-cap">Welcome! If you aren’t a member of our LARP community, you might be wondering what the heck a "Freelands" is.</p> 

Everything you read here—the scandals, the political shifts, the looming threats—is a result of real collaborative storytelling from the <a href="https://www.kingdomsofnovitas.org/" target="_blank">Kingdoms of Novitas</a> live-action roleplaying game (LARP). 

Think of this as a "living" fiction project. Each issue of the newspaper chronicles actual events that occurred during our monthly game sessions. What started as an experiment in 2023 (in-game year 1601) has grown into a three-year archive of a world that breathes and changes along with its players.

If you want to dive deeper into the lore of the world Poppy calls home, I highly recommend checking out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGJyN7LlyJN7yxlv1HTp43F4G-GrJBHe5hmr68MqmPU/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">Kingdoms of Novitas Worldbook</a>. It’s the best way to understand the history, cultures, and existential dread behind our headlines.

Whether you want to be a hero, a villain, or just another face at the tavern, the Kingdoms of Novitas community is ready to welcome you!</p>

<p class="drop-cap">
Steamy Ink Publishing is the premier source of news and information 
for the Freelands, operating two distinct publications to serve the 
diverse interests of our readership. Founded in 1601, we have been 
dedicated to truth, transparency, and the occasional well-placed rumor.

## Our Publications

### Special Investigative Press™

A division of Steamy Ink Publishing, proudly supported by the 
Journalist's Guild of Civen and generously subsidized by the 
Breaking Bulletin Consortium. Our mission is to deliver timely, 
accurate, and accessible information to the Freelands community 
through in-depth investigative journalism.

We are the first paper to successfully implement a regional press 
model, meaning that while our cover pages show the global threats 
that unite us, our interior sections are customized to specific 
locations throughout the Freelands.

### Steamy Ink Press™

Maplewood's Whispers, from Ear to Ink. A spotlight for Maplewood's 
most talked-about personalities, we are dedicated to delivering 
unparalleled, in-depth revelations about the captivating lives of 
the People of Interest who pass through our bustling town.

What are their dealings? Their true motives? Their romantic 
entanglements? It remains our mission to provide the perfect 
conversation starter for lively discussion over tea with friends.

## For Non-LARP Readers

These newspapers document actual gameplay events from 
[Kingdoms of Novitas](https://www.kingdomsofnovitas.org/){:target="_blank"}, 
a live-action roleplaying game. Character relationships, political 
developments, and dramatic incidents all reflect real player 
interactions and collaborative storytelling, presented through 
the lens of in-world journalism.

The publications chronicle the ongoing adventures, relationships, 
and existential threats facing the town of Maplewood and the greater 
Freelands region. Each issue represents actual events that occurred 
during monthly game sessions, transformed into immersive fiction.

This project has been running since 2022 (in-game year 1601), with 
monthly issues documenting three years of collaborative storytelling.

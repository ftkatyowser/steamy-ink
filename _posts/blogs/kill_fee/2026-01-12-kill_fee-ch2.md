<h2>Month Five</h2>

The estate was on edge.

Lyria wasn't cleared for the details, but she didn't need them spelled out. Meetings ran long. Doors stayed shut that were usually left ajar. Hermena's smile held a fraction too long at social functions, stretched thin like fabric pulled past its tolerance. Even the corridors felt braced, as if the house itself were waiting for something to arrive.

Penelope's performances sharpened under the pressure.

Still flawless. Still precise. But frantic now, if you knew where to look. The discipline held, but the cost was visible—a blink too late, a breath taken just out of rhythm. The mask slipped faster and snapped back harder, like a soldier forcing herself upright on a leg that shouldn't have been bearing weight anymore.

She went to Niko's room every night, as predictable as the changing of the guard. Lyria noticed departures. Returns. The way Penelope left quieter than she'd arrived, shoulders set too stiff, composure restored by effort rather than ease. Whatever that routine had once been giving her, it wasn't doing that anymore.

Lyria stopped trying to name the reason and focused on what she could see.

Repetition without relief. Compliance without recovery. A method applied again and again to someone who no longer reacted the way the method expected.

Penelope was spending more energy than she was restoring. How long the structure she had built could hold under that kind of strain was harder to tell.

Lyria kept watching anyway, because that was now part of the job.

<h2>Month Six</h2>

Lyria noticed the shift before she categorized it. The timing. The way some nights ended sooner than others. The way the quiet afterward didn't settle the same way anymore.

It happened often now. Rarely a night without it.

The change wasn't in the sounds themselves so much as what followed. Penelope moved differently the next day. Shoulders set, focus hollowed, attention pinned to tasks instead of people.

Lyria wrote that down in her report. *Functional. Detached. Running on something that isn't present anymore.*

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W25 —————</h3>

Lyria had stopped along the perimeter path in the gardens after dusk, checking the sightlines where the hedges curved inward. She heard the soft scrape of shoes on stone before she turned.

"You don't blend very well out here," Penelope noted mildly.

Lyria inclined her head. "My job isn't subtle."

"No," Penelope agreed. She paused a few paces away, hands folded loosely in front of her, posture perfect. "But you always stop in the same places."

Lyria didn't challenge the observation. Penelope looked past her, out toward the rose bushes lining the wall. For a moment she said nothing. Then—

"Do you ever want to leave?"

Lyria blinked once. "Leave the grounds?"

Penelope's mouth curved, faint and humorless. "Leave the life."

The question hung between them, soft but deliberate.

"I go where the contract takes me," Lyria said after a moment.

"That must be nice," Penelope said quietly. "To have a contract that ends."

Lyria studied her then. The silk gown chosen carefully. The hair arranged just so. The faint shadows beneath her eyes that no amount of powder quite erased.

"You are the contract," Lyria said. It wasn't kind or cruel. Just accurate.

Penelope smiled—genuine, unguarded, not the mask she wore for everyone else.

"At least you're honest," she said. They stood there for a moment, the garden holding its breath around them.

"You watch people," Penelope said at last. "Is that part of the job, or just a habit?"

"Both."

"And when you watch me," Penelope continued, turning to face her fully, "what are you looking for?"

There it was. The escalation.

"Patterns," Lyria said. "Stress points."

"And have you found any?"

Lyria considered the distance between them. The exit routes. The weight of the question.

"Yes."

Penelope nodded once, accepting the answer without asking for detail. Her fingers brushed the edge of a rose leaf absently, paying no mind to the thorn that drew a bead of red at her fingertip. She stepped back, composure settling into place as smoothly as it ever did.

"Good evening, Lieutenant."

She walked back toward the house at a measured pace. Lyria remained where she was for a moment longer.

*Responds to direct honesty*, she noted. *But only when she is ready for it.*

<h2>Month Seven</h2>

Penelope stopped using Sylvan at dinners; she answered in Common instead. Perfect timing. Flawless delivery. More controlled than ever.

It showed in the effort. Smiles held a beat too long. Shoulders locked high, never quite dropping. The finger-tap she tried to suppress slipping through anyway, quick and sharp, like a tell she couldn't quite kill.

She was trying harder to prove everything was fine.

The visits to Niko increased again. Sometimes three times in two days. Shorter now, thirty minutes at most. She came back composed, but not eased. Whatever those meetings had once given, they no longer stayed with her.

What remained was the performance, standing on its own.

<h2>Month Eight</h2>

Penelope stopped appearing in the gardens. Stopped seeking Lyria out entirely. Three weeks without a single initiated contact, where there had been several a week before. Lyria noted it and didn't go looking.

But the nights changed.

The sounds carried more often now. Longer. The intervals stretched past what Lyria had come to recognize as normal. When they stopped, Penelope didn't leave right away anymore.

She stayed. An hour, sometimes more. Niko didn't let her leave until she was steady.

Lyria heard his voice through the wall. Low, even, practiced. The cadence of reassurance. The kind meant to slow breathing, to smooth panic down into something manageable. Careful checks for redness, for swelling, for anything that would be noticed in the morning light, making sure the mask could still be worn.

And then the crying. It always came after the soothing and containment, after she'd been put back together well enough to pass inspection. The sound of something breaking through despite the pressure holding it down.

This wasn't gradual erosion anymore. Something was actively giving way.

She was certain Penelope avoided her during the day because she couldn't hide it now. Couldn't afford to be seen by someone who knew where to look.

The performance still stood. Everything else behind it was failing.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W34 —————</h3>

"She came to me asking if I thought she was broken."

Niko's voice was quiet. Another late patrol recap. His office door was closed.

"She said you made her notice something wasn't working," he continued. "That what she's been doing doesn't help anymore."

He poured two drinks and offered one to Lyria. She didn't take it.

"She asked if something was wrong with her," he finished. "If she needed to be fixed."

"What did you tell her?" Lyria asked.

"That she's high-strung." He took a measured sip. "That anxiety comes with being a patrician. That she doesn't need to dwell on it. She's doing better than most."

"You lied."

He didn't argue. Didn't justify it. Just met her gaze and let the word sit where it landed.

"You know it isn't holding," Lyria said.

"Of course I know." His tone didn't change. "But containment doesn't require improvement. It requires compliance."

"And this still counts."

"For now."

Silence gathered between them, thick and unhelpful.

"She's breaking down," Lyria said at last. "When she's with you."

"That's intentional," Niko replied. "If she needs to fall apart, it happens away from the main house."

Lyria absorbed that. The logic was clean. The cost sat heavier.

"She's going to break anyway," she said.

"I know," Niko said. "That's why I asked you to fix it before she does."

Lyria left. Went to her room.

An hour later, the sounds through the wall were worse than she'd heard before. Not louder, just longer.

The quiet took its time finding its way back.

<h2>Month Nine</h2>

Everyone could see it now.

Penelope performed constantly. Perfectly. But the strain was visible—fractional delays before smiling, tension that never left her shoulders, hands she couldn't still no matter how tightly she tried to hold them together.

No one commented. No one intervened. The estate adjusted around the strain instead of addressing it.

And then it seemingly started to work.

The pauses shortened. The smiles came on cue again. Her hands went still. She moved through dinners and meetings with renewed precision, smoother than she had been in months. The house read it as an improvement.

Lyria knew better.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W38 —————</h3>

Lyria found Penelope in the gardens during late patrol. Just sitting on a stone bench, hands folded loosely in her lap, staring at a rose bush that had already lost most of its petals.

"You shouldn't be out here alone," Lyria said.

"I needed air." Penelope didn't look at her. "Inside is—" She stopped, then tried again. "I needed air."

Lyria should have continued the route. She knew the path. Knew where this deviation would show up later in the logs.

She sat anyway.

They didn't speak at first. The garden swallowed sound; water moved somewhere beyond the hedges, distant enough to fade in and out. Cold seeped through fabric of her uniform.

"It's not working anymore," Penelope said at last.

Lyria waited. Interrogators didn't interrupt confessions in progress.

"Whatever I've been doing," Penelope continued. "It doesn't hold."

She finally looked over at Lyria.

"You noticed before I did," Penelope said. "You saw it coming."

She reached out and picked a stray rose petal off the ground. Ground it between her fingers until it tore.

"I don't know what to do now."

The words landed without polish. No hedging. No attempt to soften them.

"What happens if you stop?" Lyria asked.

Penelope swallowed. "I disappoint everyone. Fail the family. Prove they were right about me—" She cut herself off, jaw tightening. "I don't know. Nothing good."

The silence that followed was heavier than the last.

"Can I ask you something?" Penelope said, quieter now.

"Yes."

"When you watch people," Penelope asked, "do you ever stop picking them apart? Or do you just do it subconsciously?"

The question caught Lyria off guard.

"It doesn't stop," she answered.

Penelope nodded once, as if that confirmed something she'd already suspected.

"Doesn't that get tiring?" Penelope asked. "Always watching?"

Lyria considered the question, then said, "It keeps things from getting loud."

Penelope frowned slightly. "Loud?"

"Inside," Lyria said.

Penelope absorbed that. Her fingers curled once in her lap, then stilled.

"I think I do something similar," she said after a moment. "Just with… how I present. I'm always adjusting."

"That costs more."

"It does," Penelope agreed.

They sat there without speaking, long enough for the cold to become almost intolerable.

"You should go inside," Lyria said eventually. "It's getting colder."

Penelope nodded, but didn't move right away. Lyria stood and finished her patrol.

Later, in her room, the familiar sounds carried through the wall. The rise. The break. The crying that followed. Longer than usual, but cleaner. No interruption. No attempt to suppress it halfway through.

Lyria stayed awake until the barracks settled again. When they did, it settled faster than they had in a long time.

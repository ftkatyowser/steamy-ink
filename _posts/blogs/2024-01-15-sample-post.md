This is the opening paragraph of your blog post. In Jekyll, you write posts in **Markdown** which is way easier than HTML. Just write naturally and it formats itself.

To create a new blog post:
1. Create a new file in the `_posts` folder
2. Name it: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md` (the date is important!)
3. Add the front matter (the stuff between the `---` lines at the top)
4. Write your content in Markdown

## This is a Heading

Regular paragraphs are just... paragraphs. Leave a blank line between them.

You can use *italics* or **bold** easily.

> This is a blockquote. Use it for important dialogue or thoughts.
> 
> "I told you this would happen," she said.

### Smaller Heading

You can also make lists:

- Item one
- Item two  
- Item three

Or numbered lists:

1. First thing
2. Second thing
3. Third thing

Use three dashes for a horizontal rule to separate sections.

When you save this file, Jekyll automatically:
- Adds it to the blog index
- Creates the page with your layout
- Formats all the Markdown into nice HTML

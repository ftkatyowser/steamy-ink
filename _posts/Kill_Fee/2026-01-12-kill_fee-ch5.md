No material disruption to trade, logistics, or reputation has been observed during the reporting period.

Existing safeguards continue to perform within acceptable variance.


## EXTERNAL CONDITIONS

- No actionable threats identified

*Civenopolis Climate*:
- Elevated political activity among noble houses

- No impact on Katullin holdings anticipated


## INTERNAL CONDITIONS

*Household Stability*:
Household behavior remains orderly. No indicators of instability, disclosure risk, or reputational exposure persist at this time.

*Principal Family Members*:
- **Hermena Katullin:**
  Social calendar maintained at expected frequency. Alliance cultivation efforts proceed nominally, including regular correspondence with the Tormund family. Public presentation is exemplary.
- **Lucius Katullin:**

- **Lucas Katullin:**
  Training progression adequate under oversight. Demonstrates developing understanding of operational discretion. No concerns regarding heir preparation trajectory.

*External Family Monitoring*:
- **Rosalynn Katullin:**
  Freelands activity tracked via established contacts. Current location confirmed as Elfmeet, employed with a local adventuring company known as the Iron Hounds. No family contact in 18 months, no indication of return intent.

One personnel adjustment was executed during the reporting period.

**Position**: Assigned Security Lieutenant.

<h2>Month Ten</h2>

Penelope began intersecting Lyria's evening patrols.

Not overtly or in a way that could be logged as seeking contact. She just appeared where Lyria already was. In the gardens as she passed through, in the corridor as rounds ended, in the library when reports were filed.

Always with justification. Air. Books. Directionless movement that still resolved into the same places.

It was happening too often now to dismiss.

Deliberate positioning. But for what purpose?

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W43 —————</h3>

Penelope appeared during late patrol again. Gardens, as had become usual.

"You're here every night now," Lyria noted.

"Is that a problem?"

"No. Just noticing."

Penelope huffed something like a laugh and moved toward the stone bench. She sat without inviting Lyria to join her, gaze fixed on the dark shapes of the rose bushes.

"Before Lynn left," she said, "I didn't come out here alone."

The name landed heavy in the space between them.

"She hated the house at night," Penelope went on. "Said it felt like it was watching her. So we'd sneak out here instead. Sit. Talk about nothing. Or everything." A faint smile, crooked at the edges. "She used to say it was the only place she could breathe."

Lyria stayed where she was, not interrupting.

"When she left," Penelope said, "everything went quiet all at once. Not peaceful. Empty." She gestured vaguely toward the main house. "Inside, everyone adjusted. Had me fill the spaces she left. Hold them together."

"And out here?" Lyria asked.

Penelope exhaled. "Out here, I don't have to replace her."

Lyria took that in.

"It takes less work out here," she said.

Penelope glanced at her. "I'll take less of anything."

Lyria sat down on the bench beside her. Close enough that Penelope noticed, but not close enough to explain.

"What are you looking for?" Lyria asked. "By coming back here."

Penelope didn't answer right away.

"I don't know," she frowned, searching. "Something that doesn't require me to fill a space that isn't mine."

Lyria nodded once.

"You don't need me to be anything," Penelope said.

Lyria should have stepped away then. She didn't.

"No," she said. "I don't."

They stayed like that until the cold crept in and Lyria's patrol ran long.

<h2>Month Eleven</h2>

The changes were small at first.

Penelope slept through the night more often. The pacing in the corridors stopped. Meals were finished instead of abandoned halfway through. The tension in her shoulders was still there, but it no longer looked like it was bracing for impact.

No one commented on it. They rarely did when something improved. Lyria noticed anyway.

Penelope continued intersecting her patrols, but the urgency had bled out of it. She didn't arrive already wound tight. She lingered less at thresholds, and when she spoke, it wasn't a rush to fill the quiet.

One evening in the library, she sat across from Lyria without opening a book.

"You're late tonight," Penelope said.

"I had to cover another route," Lyria replied.

Penelope nodded, accepting that without pressing for more. That, too, was new. They sat in comfortable silence and when Penelope spoke again, it wasn't with the careful precision she typically used.

"I didn't go to him last night."

Lyria looked up just enough to acknowledge the statement.

"And?" she asked.

"And nothing happened," Penelope said. "I waited for it to. It didn't."

"How did you feel?"

Penelope frowned, considering. "Tired," she said finally. "But not… unraveled."

Lyria let that sit.

The next few days followed the same pattern. Fewer late departures, fewer returns carrying that brittle, over-smoothed calm. When Penelope did seek Niko out, she came back steadier. Not restored, but not stripped down to bare nerves either.

Niko noticed. Of course he did.

"You're doing something right," he said during a routine briefing.

Later that week, Penelope stopped her in the corridor after evening rounds.

"Do you ever get used to being seen?" she asked.

Lyria tilted her head. "Seen how?"

Penelope hesitated, then shrugged it off with a practiced smile. "Never mind."

The improvement held.

Penelope laughed once during dinner. A real one, surprised, like the sound had escaped without being vetted first. Hermena noticed. Abraxus didn't comment. The house adjusted around the new shape of her mood without naming it.

That night, the walls stayed quiet. Lyria marked the absence and finished her patrol on time.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W46 —————</h3>

"You've been spending more time with her."

Niko said it without looking up from the rack he was checking, like it was an already established fact. His posture was loose. His attention wasn't.

"She intersects my patrols," Lyria said. "I don't redirect her."

He glanced at her then. Brief. Assessing.

"You could sometimes," he said.

"She isn't disrupting anything," Lyria replied. "We talk."

Niko's mouth twitched.

"She used to come to me every night," he said. "Routine. Predictable. I knew when she'd show up and how she'd leave."

Lyria didn't answer.

"Now it's once a week, sometimes less." The space between them shifted. "You think that's a coincidence?"

"I think she's sleeping," Lyria said. "Eating. Finishing conversations."

Niko studied her for a moment longer than necessary.

"You're right," he said finally. "She *is* easier to manage."

The admission carried no warmth.

"Which is why I'm letting this continue," he added. "For now."

He stepped closer. Not crowding her, but close enough that the line was clear.

"But don't confuse improvement with permission," he said quietly. "She doesn't belong to you just because she's calmer around you."

Lyria met his gaze. "I'm not taking anything from you."

Niko's expression tightened, just a fraction.

"That's the problem," he said. "You are."

He turned toward the door, then paused.

"Whatever this is," he said over his shoulder, "keep it contained. If it starts costing me predictability, I will end it."

He left.

Lyria remained where she was, aware that she was no longer outside the pattern she'd been tracking.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W47 —————</h3>

They were in the garden again. Late. Quiet.

"Can I tell you something?"

Penelope's voice was steady, but her hands weren't. They rested in her lap, fingers pressed together too tightly.

"Of course."

"My grandfather wants me to marry." The words came out flat, practiced. "Marcus Flavian. Merchant family. Strategic alliance. My mother's already discussing terms."

"And you don't want to?" Lyria asked.

"I don't know." Penelope's breath hitched despite her effort to keep it even. "That's the problem. I don't know how to tell what's real anymore. Whether I don't want *him*, or whether I just resist anything that feels like another script I have to memorize."

She looked up then, searching Lyria's face.

"I'm tired of the performance," she said. "But I don't know who I am when the scene ends."

Lyria didn't answer immediately. Silence did the work.

"Have you told your grandfather no?" she asked instead.

"I haven't told him anything." Penelope shook her head. "Not yet. But eventually—" she stopped. "Eventually I'll have to decide."

"What do you want from me?" Lyria asked.

Penelope smiled faintly. Worn thin at the edges.

"I don't know. Maybe nothing. I just needed to say it out loud to someone who isn't invested in the outcome."

Lyria felt the pull of that sentence and didn't respond to it.

"You're the only person here who doesn't need me to make the right choice," Penelope said quietly.

Lyria studied her for a moment.

"You're trying to answer the question too fast," she said.

Penelope frowned. "Because if I don't—"

"Someone else will answer it for you," Lyria finished.

Silence settled.

"That's not helpful," Penelope said. There was no heat in it.

"No," Lyria agreed. "It's just true."

Penelope exhaled slowly.

"Thank you," she said. "For not telling me what to do."

"I don't," Lyria replied. "Not unless I have to."

Penelope paused at the edge of the path, then glanced back.

"I know," she said. "That's why I keep finding you."

She left.

Lyria remained in the garden longer than she needed to. The air was cold, the bench hard beneath her.

She hadn't given advice. Hadn't offered direction. But Penelope had let the uncertainty sit instead of rushing to correct it.

That was new.

<h2>Month Twelve</h2>

Penelope stopped going to Niko's quarters.

Lyria noticed the absence before she logged it. Three weeks without a visit. No late-night departures. No returns through the side corridor.

Previous baseline: *multiple times weekly for three years*.

This was complete cessation. Abrupt.

Lyria didn't speculate. Just wrote it down.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W50 —————</h3>

"She's not coming to me anymore."

Niko caught her in the armory. Not angry. Concerned, maybe.

"I noticed."

"You noticed." He stepped closer. "Did you tell her to stop?"

"No."

"Did you suggest she didn't need to?"

"No."

"But she stopped. Which means whatever she needed from me, she's found a replacement." His voice was flat. Certain. "She requires routine, Lyria. She doesn't self-regulate."

"I don't provide routine," Lyria responded. "And I don't give commands."

"That's the problem." He held her gaze. "You're trying to take the leash off to see where she'll run."

"I'm not trying to hold a leash."

"Exactly." His eyes narrowed. "And now she thinks she doesn't need one. She's withdrawing from the discipline that kept her functional."

"She's making choices."

"Influenced by validation."

"I'm just listening."

"Listening is poison when the goal is obedience." He didn't raise his voice. Didn't need to. "Your job is estate security. Not creating dependencies I didn't approve."

Lyria didn't respond.

"If this continues," Niko said, "I'll intervene."

"I understand," Lyria said.

He left.

Lyria finished her inventory. Her hands were steady. That worried her.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W52 —————</h3>

"I told my mother no."

Penelope found her in the gardens just after dusk, breathless. Not from exertion, but from momentum.

"About Marcus Flavian?"

"Yes." Penelope swallowed. "I told her I'm not marrying him. That I need time to figure out what I actually want instead of accepting what's expected."

"How did she take it?" Lyria asked.

"She said I was selfish. That I'm proving I'm as irresponsible as Lynn." Penelope smiled, brittle but real. "But I said no. I actually said it."

"That's—" Lyria stopped. Reframed. "That's a decision."

"Yes." Penelope stepped closer. "And I knew I could make it because you kept asking what I wanted instead of how I should manage the consequences."

"I didn't tell you to refuse."

"I know." Penelope's voice softened. "You just didn't try to correct me."

"I didn't guide you to that answer," Lyria said. "I didn't steer you."

"I know. But for the first time I can remember, someone told me I could make my own choice. So I did."

She left before Lyria could respond. Lyria remained where she was, the garden cooling around her.

This wasn't observation anymore. Penelope was acting on the space Lyria had given her, and the results were visible. That was the point of intervention.

It also meant Lyria was no longer outside the outcome.

She acknowledged that, filed it where it belonged, and did not assign it a name.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W53 —————</h3>

Lyria was reviewing patrol logs when she heard footsteps in the corridor. Slower than usual. Uneven. They stopped outside her door.

Then a knock. Quiet. Careful.

Lyria opened it.

Penelope stood there in her nightdress, hair loose, no jewelry, no practiced expression ready to lift into place. She looked smaller like this—not fragile, just unarmored.

"Can I come in?" she asked.

Lyria should have redirected her. Should have sent her back to her rooms or sent her to the Captain's room.

"Yes," she said instead.

Penelope stepped inside and sat on the edge of the bed without being invited. Lyria closed the door and remained standing, unsure where to put her hands.

"I couldn't sleep," Penelope said. "Everything in my room feels… crowded. Like it's all watching me."

Lyria waited.

After a moment, Penelope looked up at her. "What do you actually do for him?" she asked.

Lyria blinked. "For Captain Kovali?"

"Yes." Penelope leaned back slightly, studying her now. "I know he doesn't promote people for being agreeable. And he doesn't keep anyone around who doesn't have a use."

That made Lyria smile. She turned the question around.

"What do you think I do?" she asked.

Penelope huffed softly. "Interrogator," she said. "Of some kind. He doesn't trust charm. He trusts pressure. And you aren't exactly charming, but you love to put pressure on people."

Lyria laughed at the acknowledgement, and considered denying it. Decided there was no point.

"You're right," she said. "I sit with people until they realize I'm not going to help them lie."

Penelope tilted her head slightly.

"I don't threaten," Lyria continued. "I don't bargain. I let them start with the version of the lie they can live with. Then I let the silence do the work. Silence lets the mind itch. Most people talk eventually just to scratch it."

Penelope nodded once, as if that confirmed something she'd already been holding.

"That makes sense," she said. "You don't rush. You don't fill silence. You don't rescue people from their own answers."

Lyria felt the faint, unwelcome recognition of being seen.

"And you?" Lyria asked. "What is your job?"

"I used to be the one who found people. The one who got them comfortable enough to talk. I was… decorative. Useful." She twisted a ring that was on her finger. "Lynn did the rest."

"And now?" Lyria asked.

"And now," Penelope said quietly, "I stay in the room."

She exhaled, not quite a laugh. "I'm the one who explains consequences. Who makes threats sound reasonable. Who lets people believe they're being heard, even when nothing I say is a promise."

Her gaze dropped to her hands, fingers now twisting in the fabric of her nightdress.

"Lynn could do it clean. She never hesitated." A breath, uneven. "I do. When it turns physical. When someone bleeds and I'm still standing there, knowing exactly how far it's going to go."

Her fingers tightened.

"That part doesn't stay behind when I leave," she said. "It comes back with me. Some nights I wake up gasping, like I'm drowning. Like the blood is in my lungs."

Lyria didn't interrupt the confession.

"But if I don't do it," she said at last, quieter, "someone else will. And they won't hesitate. They won't stop to wonder where the line was."

She looked up.

"That's usually how it starts," Lyria acknowledged.

Penelope hesitated. "Does it ever get easier?"

"No. You just get clearer about why you're doing it."

That seemed to settle something. Penelope's shoulders dropped—not all the way, but enough to matter.

"So you're not here to fix me," she said.

"No."

"You're not trying to make me better at it."

"No."

Penelope considered that. Then, softly: "You're just… paying attention to me."

"Yes."

Penelope smiled then. Not the practiced one, but something small and unguarded.

"That's new," she said.

They sat in silence after that. Not awkward. Not heavy. Just quiet enough to let breathing even out.

Eventually, Penelope stood.

"I should go," she said. "Before this turns into something it isn't."

Lyria nodded. "Probably."

Penelope paused at the door.

"For what it's worth," she said, "it helps. Knowing what I'm actually doing. Knowing I'm not just… a failure."

Lyria inclined her head. "That's not what I'm seeing, Penelope."

Penelope let out a small laugh.

"You can call me Poppy," she said. "That's who I am under all of this. Penelope's just who everyone else sees."

The door clicked shut behind her before Lyria could respond.

She didn't log the encounter right away; not because it couldn't be written up, but because the language didn't exist yet. Penelope hadn't sought comfort or asked for reassurance.

She'd asked to be understood, and Lyria had provided that.

That alone should not have felt consequential, but it did.

<h2>Month Thirteen</h2>

Penelope came to Lyria's room several nights a week now.

Always late. Always quiet. Always with the same careful knock, like she was checking whether the door would open.

They didn't do anything. Penelope would sit on the bed or the chair, wrapped in a blanket, shoulders slowly lowering as the minutes passed. Sometimes she talked. Sometimes she didn't. Sometimes she just breathed until the tightness left her chest enough to attempt sleep.

After an hour, sometimes two, she would stand, thank Lyria softly, and leave.

Lyria wrote it down the first few times. Frequency. Duration. Context. Then she stopped; the pattern no longer required documentation.

What unsettled her wasn't Penelope's dependence, but how reliably it reproduced.

*This is a problem,* she thought, distantly.

She didn't stop opening the door.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W53 —————</h3>

"You're off your baseline."

Niko said it during the morning briefing, casual enough that it could have passed as nothing.

Lyria looked at him. Didn't ask him to clarify.

"You missed a timing discrepancy in your west patrol report. Logged the same route twice yesterday." He tapped the papers. "You don't make errors like that. Your focus is drifting."

Lyria considered lying. Didn't.

"Penelope," she said.

"Still." Not a question. "I told you to keep it contained."

"She comes to me."

"Do you lock your door?"

Silence.

"No."

"Then you're not containing anything." He leaned back slightly, voice measured. "What does she want?"

"Validation," Lyria said. "A witness who isn't paid to grade the performance."

"And what do you want?"

The question landed harder than Lyria expected.

"I want—" She stopped. Corrected. "I want access. To the version of her that exists when the script ends."

Niko's expression tightened. "That's worse."

"Why?"

"Because that version isn't cleared for security." He straightened. "Abraxus asked me yesterday why his granddaughter seems… different."

Lyria felt it land. "Different how?"

"He didn't say. He doesn't need to. He asked who'd been spending time with her. Who'd been calming her down." Niko's mouth tightened. "Because he knows it isn't me."

"And you told him—"

"That she's settling. Growing into herself. That whatever we were doing finally worked."

The silence stretched longer than before.

"I didn't give him your name."

"But." Lyria prompted.

"But Abraxus doesn't stop at answers," Niko said quietly. "He looks for the question. And when he finds it, he removes whoever's asking it."

Lyria nodded once. "So he'll find me."

"Yes." Niko turned toward the door. "Which is why I'm telling you to end this. Not because it's dangerous." He glanced back at her. "Because it's about to look intentional."

Lyria sat alone with the knowledge that Abraxus had noticed the change. Once he noticed something, it stopped being temporary.

When the knock came that night, she knew what she was choosing.

She opened the door anyway.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W57 —————</h3>

"I think my mother suspects something."

Penelope said it quietly, curled on Lyria's bed, the blanket pulled tight around her shoulders.

"Suspects what?"

"That there's someone. Well, that I care about someone. She asked if that's why I refused Marcus. If I was holding out for a better offer."

Lyria felt the shift immediately. Not panic or fear. Just pressure settling over them.

"What did you tell her?"

"That there wasn't." Penelope's gaze stayed on the wall. "She didn't believe me. She said I had the look of someone keeping a secret."

Another pause. Longer this time.

"Is she wrong?" Lyria asked.

Penelope didn't answer right away. She twisted the edge of the blanket between her fingers, slow and methodical.

"She thinks I'm in love," she said finally. "I don't know if that's the right word for this."

"What is the right word?" Lyria asked.

Penelope turned toward her then, eyes open in a way that made looking away feel deliberate.

"Visibility," she said. "I've found someone who actually sees me."

The silence that followed was dense, waiting.

"You're mistaking attention for attachment," Lyria said. Careful. Controlled. A line drawn where one still could be.

"I don't care what you call it," Penelope said. She shifted closer, not touching yet, giving Lyria time to stop her. "I just know that when you look at me, I don't disappear. I'm not putting on a performance. I'm just Poppy."

She rested her head against Lyria's shoulder, closing her eyes and breathing deeply.

Lyria didn't move. She knew exactly what this was. Knew where it would lead. Knew what it would cost if she didn't end it now.

But interrogators didn't interrupt confessions once they started.

That night, Penelope fell asleep against her shoulder.

<h2>Month Fourteen</h2>

The pattern continued.

Penelope came to Lyria's room nightly and sat with her. Sometimes she talked, sometimes she didn't. That part hadn't changed.

But after her confession, the closeness did.

She leaned in now without hesitation, resting her head against Lyria's shoulder as if it belonged there. Her fingers would find Lyria's hand and stay, assuming contact rather than requesting it.

Lyria noticed it the way you notice a weight settling, or a sound becoming part of the room. Not alarming or unwelcome, just… present. She was slower to step back from it than she should have been.

There was warmth. The steady rise and fall of another person's breathing. The absence of tension she'd come to expect when someone crossed a boundary. Nothing in her reacted the way it usually did. That should have been the moment she moved away.

She didn't.

Not because she couldn't, but because she wanted to see what happened if she didn't.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W59 —————</h3>

They sat on the edge of the bed. Close, but not touching. Penelope was vibrating. Not visibly shaking, but tight in a way Lyria recognized immediately. Jaw set too hard, hands braced on the bed like she was getting ready to take flight.

"Can I ask you something?" she asked suddenly, breaking the silence.

"Yes."

"What am I to you?" The question came out clean. "Am I a person? Or am I just the most interesting abnormality in the estate?"

Lyria looked at her. She could have softened it. Could have given the answer people gave when they wanted to preserve something.

She didn't.

"You're a forgery." She said.

Penelope flinched but didn't look away.

"A perfect copy of a person, but the ink is still wet." Lyria continued. "A performance that forgot it was acting. I've spent over a year trying to find where the mask ends and the person begins."

The silence stretched thin.

Then Penelope exhaled. Slowly. Her shoulders dropped.

"Good," she said.

Lyria frowned. "Good?"

"Niko treats me like I'm made of glass," Penelope said. "Like I'll shatter if he sets me down wrong." She shifted closer, not touching yet, but closing the space deliberately. "You don't want to stop me from breaking. You want to take me apart and see how the pieces go back together."

"Yes," Lyria said. The answer was immediate and honest.

Penelope smiled fiercely. "Then do it."

She reached out first.

Her hand closed around Lyria's wrist, warm and steady, guiding it up to her face. Lyria felt the pulse there, fast and uneven under her thumb.

*This is a breach of position,* she thought. She should pull back, redirect the momentum while it was still reversible.

Penelope leaned in, close enough that Lyria could feel her breath, could see the faint tremor at the corner of her mouth.

"I don't want to be watched from across the room," Penelope said quietly. "I want to know what happens when someone stays."

Interrogators didn't interrupt confessions.

Lyria closed the distance and kissed her.

It wasn't gentle. It wasn't tentative. It was precise, a test of response, pressure, willingness. Penelope made a sound at the back of her throat and leaned into it immediately, hands sliding up to Lyria's upper arms, anchoring herself there like she'd been waiting for permission that never needed to be spoken.

When they broke apart, Penelope looked undone.

"I love you," she said. The words landed heavy and final, the weight pressing over them like a wool blanket.

Lyria didn't say it back. She lifted a hand, brushing her thumb across Penelope's lower lip, grounding her where the words still lingered.

"I know," she said.

Penelope closed her eyes and leaned into the touch, accepting the answer as if it were enough.

When she finally left near dawn, Lyria stayed where she was on the edge of the bed. She went back over it once, not in order. Just the parts that wouldn't settle.

Her hand.

The pause.

The way Penelope had leaned in as if there were nowhere else to go.

Her fingers still felt warm as she lay back and stared at the ceiling, waiting for the consequences.

<h2>Month Fifteen</h2>

After the kiss, the boundaries stopped holding.

Penelope still came to Lyria's room, but the visits no longer ended where they used to. Talking ran out and neither of them moved away. Sitting close became leaning. Leaning became weight.

Lyria told herself she could still keep it contained, that touch didn't have to mean anything, that presence didn't have to become permission. Penelope didn't ask permission; she just took it like it had already been given.

Lyria should have corrected it, but she didn't. It was easier to see what would happen when no one interrupted them.

She knew how this would read if it came to light. She knew who would be blamed for letting it go this far.

She still left the door unbolted.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W61 —————</h3>

"She hasn't been to my quarters in two months."

Niko said it like small talk. They were alone in the armory, inventory half-finished, the door shut.

"I know," Lyria said.

He didn't look at her. "You know because you're keeping track? Or because she's coming to you instead?"

Silence answered before words did. Niko set the inventory slate down carefully, then turned and looked at her properly.

"She is." He let that sit for a moment. "The walls in the barracks are thin, you know that."

Lyria opened her mouth to deny it; she didn't like sloppy conclusions. Closed it. Opened it again.

"I've lost the ability to observe without influence," she said instead. "But don't confuse that with attachment, Captain."

Niko's mouth tightened.

"Does she know the difference?" he asked.

Lyria hesitated. "No."

Niko's jaw tightened. Not anger—something narrower. Possessive.

"Then she's already crossed the line," he said quietly. "And you let her."

Lyria met his gaze. "This isn't about protocol."

"No. It's about *access*, isn't it?" His eyes flicked over her. "You wanted what she looks like when the script drops. Congratulations. You've got it."

He leaned back against the table, arms crossing. The stance he took when something had slipped out of his control and he was deciding how much force it would take to pull it back.

"She used to come to me when she couldn't hold herself together," he said. "I knew when. I knew why. I knew how long it would last."

Silence.

"Now she goes to you," he continued. "And I don't know what you give her. I don't know what she leaves with."

"You don't like not knowing," Lyria said.

"I don't like losing leverage," Niko replied. "Especially over something that used to come to me when it broke."

"She didn't break," Lyria said.

"She did," he said. "I just knew how to put her back together."

"But you're not stopping me," Lyria said.

Niko looked at her for a long moment. "No," he said. "Because stopping you now would mean admitting you matter more than I do."

She stopped moving. Stared at him.

"Rule one," he said. Captain's voice. "You don't fuck with the bag."

She didn't respond.

"The bag is why we survive mistakes," he continued. "Distance. Plausible deniability. The ability to say this wasn't personal."

He met her eyes.

"You made it personal."

Lyria said nothing.

He turned for the door, then stopped.

"For what it's worth," he said, conversational tone back, "this was always going to happen."

There was no clean exit anymore. She'd known that the moment she stopped enforcing the line.

And when the knock came that night, soft and familiar, she opened the door anyway.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W63 —————</h3>

"Run away with me."

Penelope's voice, breathing still uneven. They were lying together on Lyria's bed, sheets disturbed, her leg thrown carelessly over Lyria's hip.

"What?"

"We can run away. Leave Civen. Go to the Freelands like Lynn did." Penelope propped herself up on one elbow. "We could just—leave. Find her. Start over somewhere no one knows us."

"Poppy—"

"I know it's impossible. I know I have obligations, family, expectations." Her voice was steady but her eyes were bright. "But what if we just—what if we said fuck it and left?"

Lyria felt the familiar part of her mind reach for structure. Outcomes, distance, consequences. And then there was the other impulse. Quieter, less disciplined. The one that didn't want to measure anything at all.

Leaving. Removing constraints. Seeing who Penelope became when no one was watching for obedience. For a moment, the path unfolded cleanly. No guards. No reports. No corrections.

"Your family would find us. Abraxus has reach," Lyria finally said. "Resources. He wouldn't just let you go."

Penelope stiffened. "Lynn managed it."

Lyria shook her head once. "They weren't watching the exits then. They are now."

"Lucas is the one Grandpa wants to inherit everything," Penelope said. "He carries the name. They don't need me for succession."

Lyria hesitated, because she knew what the next sentence would do.

"Lucas secures the bloodline," she said. "But he can't buy an alliance."

Penelope went very still.

"You're the coin, Poppy," Lyria finished quietly.

Silence spread between them.

"So we're trapped," Penelope said.

"You're the only asset they have left to trade," Lyria replied. "They won't let you walk away."

They lay there without speaking. The reality settled slowly, heavy and inescapable.

When Penelope kissed her again, it was longer than usual. When they pulled apart, she was crying.

"Promise me something," she whispered.

"What?"

"If this ends badly—if something happens—promise me you'll remember this was real. That I chose it. That you didn't push or twist or—" She broke off, breath hitching. "Promise me you'll remember I was here because I wanted to be."

"I promise," Lyria said.

She didn't add anything else. Didn't correct her. Didn't qualify the promise with what she knew.

They stayed like that until dawn, skin cooling, the room smelling faintly of sweat and crushed linens.

<h2>Month Sixteen</h2>

The scrutiny sharpened; it wasn't subtle anymore.

Guards Lyria didn't recognize rotated into nearby routes. Hermena's questions at dinner stopped circling and started probing. Lucas lingered at thresholds, watching the spaces between patrols instead of the patrols themselves.

They weren't watching Penelope. They were watching around her.

Lyria logged it. Reduced unnecessary movement. Changed routes. Adjusted timing. If there was going to be an investigation, she wasn't going to make it easy for them.

Penelope still came to her room, but less often now. Twice a week instead of every other night, each visit quieter, shorter, both of them listening for footsteps that didn't belong.

"You're planning something," Penelope said one night, lying beside her. Lyria didn't answer immediately.

"That wasn't a question," Penelope added. Calm. Certain. "I can tell when someone is moving pieces on the board."

They laid in the silence for some time before Lyria spoke.

"I'm planning contingencies," she said finally.

"For escape."

"For extraction," Lyria said. "Escape gets you chased. Extraction gets you gone."

Penelope shifted onto her side, propping herself on one elbow. She studied Lyria's face like she was reading a familiar text for new meaning.

"You've been asking about the Freelands," she said quietly. "About Paragon. About routes that don't require family identification."

Lyria exhaled, not confirming or denying.

"You asked once where Lynn went. Twice who helped her leave. Then you stopped asking about us and started asking about maps."

Lyria closed her eyes. She continually underestimated how observant this woman was.

"You're trying to get me out," Penelope sounded hopeful, but hesitant. "Alone."

"Yes."

"You aren't coming with me."

"No."

"Why? Why can't I go with you?"

"If we go together, we're a target," Lyria said. "Two people moving slowly, trying to disappear together. We'd be caught in a week."

"And if I go alone?"

"If you go alone," Lyria said, "while I stay here and misdirect the search, you vanish."

Silence. Lyria felt the realization land.

"You're not planning to meet me later," Penelope whispered. "You're planning to be a distraction."

"I'm planning to make sure you survive the transport," Lyria said.

Penelope lay back, staring at the ceiling.

"You think you're saving me," she said after a while.

"I'm working toward the only outcome that gets you out alive."

"You think if you cut the cord, I'll be able to run faster."

"Dependency becomes a leash," Lyria said. "And right now, I'm the one holding it."

Penelope turned her head and looked at her then. Really looked.

"I won't leave you behind," she said. "Even if it's smarter. Even if it's safer."

That scared Lyria more than the scrutiny outside, because loyalty was the one thing she couldn't plan for.

And in an extraction, loyalty got people killed.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W68 —————</h3>

The family meeting was routine. Estate business, trade negotiations, social calendar.

Abraxus turned to Penelope.

"The Tormund contract," he said. "Your mother and I have been negotiating terms. We'll need you to attend the signing dinner next month. Full formal presentation."

Lyria catalogued Penelope's body language from her position by the wall.

Shoulders straight. Expression calm. Performance ready.

"No." Simple, direct, no room for argument.

The room went still. The scratching of the scribe's quill stopped.

"I'm sorry?" Hermena's voice was pleasant.

"I said no. I'm not attending. The Tormund family is hemorrhaging capital. Their dock holdings are under investigation for smuggling. If I stand next to them, I validate a failing investment." Poppy's voice was clear as she turned Abraxus' language without hesitation.

He studied her, eyes narrowing. "This is a strategic alliance, Penelope. The terms are settled."

"For you, maybe," she countered. "But I am the face of this family's future. And I won't be used to whitewash a second-rate merchant house just because you need their shipping lanes."

An absolute silence fell over the office.

"You are not the strategist here," Abraxus finally said, voice dropping an octave. "You are the instrument." His gaze flicked briefly to the wall where Lyria stood and then back.

"Then stop playing me out of tune," Penelope said evenly. "I'll attend events that elevate us. I won't be spent to fix your accounting errors."

"We'll discuss this later," Abraxus said coldly. "Privately."

The meeting ended. Lyria categorized the shift.

Penelope hadn't just refused; she had learned how to argue like them. Learned where the leverage lived, and how to apply it in public. It was brilliant.

And it was dangerous.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W69 —————</h3>

The Captain found her in the armory, sharpening her sword.

"Abraxus is concerned about Penelope."

"I know."

"No," Niko said, closing the door behind him. "You don't. He's concerned she's becoming *independent*."

Lyria paused in her sharpening. "She handled that meeting without a handler."

"Exactly," Niko said. "She didn't look for a prompt. She didn't wait to be corrected."

He leaned back against a table, arms crossed, claiming space.

"You don't understand what you took from me," he said. "She was safe when she was fractured. The pieces needed to be held together." His gaze flicked over her. "You fused the cracks."

"I made her capable," Lyria said. "Capability is an asset."

Niko didn't answer immediately. His eyes stayed on the blade in her hand.

"Capability is a liability," he said at last, "when the structure depends on fear. A frightened heir stays where she's placed. A capable one starts noticing who's been placing her."

"She isn't leaving," Lyria said.

"No," Niko agreed. "She's staying and making decisions." His mouth tightened. "She refused a directive and defended it in public. That isn't composure."

Lyria set the blade down carefully. "So what do they want? Her barely holding it together?"

"They want her predictable." His mouth tightened. "And you taught her how not to be."

The silence, for the first time Lyria could remember, felt uncomfortable.

"So what happens now?" she asked.

Niko didn't answer right away. When he did, his voice was cooler.

"Now Abraxus removes the influence that made her change," Niko didn't raise his voice, but the room felt smaller anyway. "And this is where I stop covering for you."

Lyria didn't look away. "You told me to fix it."

"I told you to contain it," he snapped. Just enough heat to show the crack. "To keep it subtle. To stop it from spilling into the open."

"You told me to make her manageable."

"There's a difference between manageable and aware."

Silence stretched between them, sharp with things neither of them said.

"You wanted her calmer," Lyria replied. "You wanted her sleeping, eating, standing on her own in a room full of sharks. That's what this looks like."

"That's what it looks like when it's done quietly," Niko said. "Not when she starts thinking the choices are hers."

"You don't like that she doesn't come to you anymore."

Niko's jaw tightened in confirmation.

"She was safe when she broke where I could see it. She came apart in my hands. I knew how to put her back together." His gaze hardened. "You didn't put her back together. You taught her how not to need it."

"So now I'm the problem?" Lyria said.

"Now you're the liability," Niko replied. "Because Abraxus doesn't care who meant well. He cares who changed the shape of his asset. And I won't stand between you and that anymore."

Lyria inclined her head. "Understood."

"I hope so," Niko said. "Because when he comes, it won't be about protecting Penelope. It'll be about taking care of whoever convinced her the leash wasn't necessary."

He left. Lyria stood alone in the armory, staring at the blade on the table.

She had armed Penelope. And arming someone against the Katullins was an act of treason.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W69 —————</h3>

"Lieutenant Hale." Abraxus's voice, low and resonant, rang out from behind her. She pivoted on her heel.

He was alone in the corridor, standing exactly in the center of the rug, hands clasped behind his back. He wasn't blocking her path, just occupying it, but the presence was enough.

"Sir."

"Walk with me."

He didn't wait for her assent.

They moved without speaking through the gardens. The gravel crunched under their boots—his heavy and rhythmic, hers silent by habit. He led her away from the house, toward the high hedges where the sightlines were obscured.

"You've been exemplary during your time here," Abraxus said finally. He didn't look at her. He was watching a gardener trim a distant rosebush. "Efficient. Discreet. Disciplined."

"Thank you, sir."

"Which is why I'm offering you something generous."

He stopped near the fountain. The water crashed against the stone, a wall of white noise that would make it difficult for anyone to overhear.

"A transfer. To a contract in Paragon. Double your current stipend. A letter of recommendation that will open any door in the city." He turned his head slowly, locking eyes with her. His face was a mask of polite indifference.

"And if I prefer to stay here?"

"Then you're not as intelligent as your file suggests." The pleasantness didn't leave his voice. "Let me be clear, Lieutenant." He took a step closer. Not enough to be an attack, but enough to invade her tactical space.

"My granddaughter has been showing some… concerning symptoms since you took an interest in her. Questioning family strategy. Refusing alliances. Believing she has the right to assign her own value."

"She is showing strength, sir. I thought that was the objective."

"Strength is useful when directed outward, towards others." Abraxus corrected. He brushed a speck of invisible dust from his sleeve. "When directed inward, against the family that supports her, it is friction."

He looked up from his sleeve.

"You stabilized her, and in doing so, you taught her she could look up instead of down."

"She is the last female heir you have," Lyria said, holding her ground. She kept her hands loose at her sides, resisting the urge to cross them. "She should be looking up."

"She is not the last female heir, but she is the remaining currency," Abraxus said with a terrifying lack of emotion. "And currency doesn't get to negotiate."

"I am trying to make sure she survives the transaction."

"And yet, you are making her think she can refuse it." His eyes narrowed, the skin around them tightening. "So now you are leaving."

Lyria met his eyes. "This is an order, not an offer."

"Yes. But I'm framing it generously because I appreciate discretion."

He leaned in. She could smell the expensive soap he used, and the faint, metallic scent of the ink on his fingers.

"You have three days to accept the transfer and vanish. After that, I stop treating you as an employee and start treating you as a trespasser."

"And if I become a trespasser?"

"Then we have protocols for removal," Abraxus said softly. "And they are rarely survived."

He held her gaze for several seconds, then turned his back on her and began to walk toward the house, his stride unhurried. He didn't need to look back.

Lyria stood alone by the fountain, the spray dampening her uniform. The solution was obvious.

Take the money. Leave. Survive.

But it meant leaving Penelope to be spent.

And for the first time in her career, the smart play felt like a failure.

<h2>Month Seventeen</h2>

Lyria knocked on Penelope's door. She didn't wait for permission before entering, closing the door and locking it behind her.

Penelope looked up from her vanity, surprised. "What are you—"

"Abraxus offered me a transfer to Paragon. I'm leaving in three days."

Penelope stood so fast the chair scraped back. The hairbrush slipped from her fingers and clattered to the floor. "What?"

"It's another security contract. Double the stipend." Lyria kept her voice bland. Bored. "I accepted."

"You're..." Penelope stopped. Blinked. "You're just leaving? After everything?"

"It's a better contract." Lyria kept her voice calm, mask in place. "I'd be a fool to refuse it."

"The smart choice," the words trembled. "And what about us?"

"This was an assignment."

Penelope looked as if the room had shifted under her feet. "An assignment."

"You're stable now," Lyria said. "Functional. You don't need me anymore."

"That's a lie," Penelope said. "You said—"

"I said what kept things moving," Lyria cut in. She stepped closer, deliberately. "You mistook my attention for something more."

Penelope stared at her, searching her face for the crack, the person she believed was there. Lyria gave her nothing.

Then Penelope moved, and she didn't stop her. The slap cracked through the room, snapping Lyria's head to the side. It stung, hot and sharp.

"Get out."

"Poppy—"

"*Don't call me that*." Her voice broke, then steadied again by force. "You made me believe I mattered to you."

"You did," Lyria said quietly. "As long as I was here."

Penelope's mask finally shattered.

"I loved you," she whispered. "I actually loved you."

Lyria didn't answer. She turned, opened the door, and stepped into the corridor. Closed it behind her.

For a moment, she stood still.

Glass shattered against the inside of the door, then a sob, then nothing.

Good.

If Penelope hated her, she would run. She would hesitate if any other emotion was at play.

Lyria touched her cheek, already bruising, and walked away.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W70 —————</h3>

She left the estate within hours.

The transfer was clean and official. Abraxus's signature was precise, the severance generous enough to read as gratitude rather than a bribe. No loose ends, no cause for audit.

She didn't go to Paragon. The Captain told her that was just for the paperwork, that there was not a contingency planned in Paragon.

"Just go somewhere you can lay low for a while." he said, not meeting her eyes as she reported to his office for orders.

She went to Talhaven, a trade town on the border. Close enough to move quickly, far enough to wait and see whether the system corrected itself or collapsed under its own weight.

And then she began working on logistics.

Lyria made inquiries through channels that didn't leave trails: safe houses outside noble jurisdiction, sanctuaries that traded anonymity for coin rather than bribes. Bunkers. Places where a high-value person could disappear without becoming someone else's leverage.

She contacted old military connections, asked about quiet departures, looked for clean transfers, found routes that didn't intersect with Katullin House oversight.

She reached into the Vleanoan underground next. People who moved Faekin across borders without paperwork or sentiment, who had the connections and were as discreet as Vleanoan rebels could be.

She reverse engineered Rosalynn's path—not to reunite them, but to understand the breach. Who had unlocked the gate? Who had looked away? How had the eldest managed to get out and stay away for so long?

She wrote nothing down that couldn't be burned. Asked questions that sounded theoretical. Paid in favors, not coin. She planned an option, not a rescue. Rescues created obligations.

When the corridor was clear, she would go back quietly. She would give Penelope the map, the window, her sister's location, and the choice. And then she would step away.

Because choice was the real question now.

Given the option, would someone raised to rely on a structure they desperately wanted to escape actually leave it?

<h2>Month Eighteen</h2>

A week after her departure, communications went quiet.

No messages, no follow-up, nothing that required her attention or consent. She continued talking to her contacts, planning a route. Talhaven was meant to be temporary. She expected a summons to another post in the Freelands anytime; she wanted to have her research done before it arrived.

Three weeks later, she still hadn't received it.

The Captain arrived on the fourth week. He knocked once and then stepped inside like it was the most natural thing in the world.

"Abraxus closed the file," he said by way of greeting. "You're officially cleared. No further review."

They stood in the kitchenette of her rented room. Cheap wood, narrow counter, a single coffee kettle already half-empty from her earlier cup. Niko didn't ask if she wanted more, just poured cups for them and handed her a mug.

Lyria accepted it. She leaned against the counter, watching him. He was relaxed in the way he only ever was when a job was finished.

"So that's it," she said.

"Yes."

"No follow-up. No problems."

"The estate adjusted."

That should have reassured her. It didn't.

"She is changing though," Lyria said. "You've seen it."

"Yes."

She took a swallow of the coffee. It was bitter, likely the cheap grounds she'd bought at the local market.

"She can't stay there," Lyria continued, as if this were still a professional debrief. "Not if you actually want her stable. She needs distance. Somewhere structured. Somewhere she isn't required to—"

"—perform," Niko finished.

Lyria paused. Looked at him.

"You already knew that," she said.

"I knew you'd reach that conclusion."

Silence. Uncomfortable. Lyria scratched at her throat.

"I've made inquiries," she said. "Nothing irreversible. It would look like a health retreat. Temporary. Abraxus wouldn't even—"

"—notice until she was gone," Niko finished.

Uncomfortable silence again. Lyria laughed softly.

"You're acting like I'm staging a coup."

Niko looked at her then. "You're acting like she's yours to move."

"I'm preventing a mental break."

"You're taking something that used to come to me when it broke," he replied.

"That's not what this is."

"No?" His mouth twitched. "You didn't ask. You didn't clear it. You didn't even pretend this was for her."

"I fixed her like you asked." She felt her breath catch. Inhaled deeply.

"No, you replaced me. And now you want to walk her out to see what will happen when she doesn't have me."

Lyria didn't answer.

"Contracts don't care about intent," Niko went on. "They care about who touched what. And you touched something that wasn't yours."

She felt a subtle heaviness behind her eyes, exhaustion at the conversation creeping in. She took another drink without thinking, trying to clear the fog.

"You knew this was where it would go. You've known for months."

"Yes."

The answer landed wrong, but she couldn't place why. She went to set her mug down and her hand missed the edge of the table by an inch.

The ceramic shattered on the floor. She stared at the shards.

Clumsy.

No. Numb. Her fingers hadn't felt the handle let go.

"You're very calm," she said, looking at the Captain.

He sipped his coffee leisurely, as if waiting for something. "So are you."

The room tilted. Just slightly. Enough to register. Too fast to be exhaustion.

The coffee.

"You poisoned me."

"Yes." There was no emotion behind the words.

She exhaled, a short breath that turned into a laugh she didn't mean to make.

"That's... inefficient," she wheezed. "I'm not a liability yet."

"You were a liability months ago. I just needed to let you help me break her first."

Her legs gave out. The chair caught her awkwardly, sliding back against the wall. She slumped, the strength draining out of her.

"But I was right." Her tongue felt thick. Heavy. "About her."

"I know." He watched her breathing slow, something like regret flickering and vanishing in his eyes. "Shame, really. Good interrogators are hard to find."

"Does—she know?" Lyria's vision was dimming. Gray static closing in. "Does she know—what you're doing?"

"She thinks you took the money and ran."

"Good," Lyria said faintly. "Let her think that. Better than—"

"—knowing the truth," Niko finished. "This way she blames herself. Thinks she wasn't worth staying for. That kind of damage is very cooperative." He set the cup down on the counter, walked over to her. "Thank you, by the way. For making this easy."

"Tell her—" Lyria stopped. Started again. "Tell her I'm sorry."

"No."

Lyria tried to focus on him. On the absence of tells. On how she'd spent eighteen months analyzing Penelope and not the person who had been managing the outcome the entire time.

The gray turned to black. Her breathing stopped.

Niko waited a full minute, then crouched over her. He tilted her chin up and looked into her eyes, glassed over and fixed on nothing.

"I told you not to fuck with the bag, Lieutenant," he whispered to the empty room.

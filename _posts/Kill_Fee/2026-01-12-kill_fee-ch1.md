<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Log Entry</strong>: Lieutenant Lyria Hale</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Unit</strong>: Kovali Contract Guard, Civen Detachment</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Assignment</strong>: Katullin Estate / Asset Protection</p>


<h2>Month One</h2>

The Civen assignment was a promotion, technically. Estate security paid better than Freelands contracts. Fewer kazvaks, more politics. 

Lyria could handle politics. She’d been working under Captain Nikolas Kovali for three years already; wealthy patricians couldn’t be much harder.

"Lieutenant Hale," The Captain greeted her at the gate with her rank. The one he used in public. "How was the road?"

Niko turned and started walking without waiting for an answer, already assuming she’d follow. She did. Same distance as always—close enough that his elbow brushed her arm once, neither of them reacting.

"Long. Telfor sends his regards."

"I’m sure he does," Niko snorted at the name. "I’ll show you the grounds. You’ll get the briefing tonight. You meet the family at dinner."

"What happened to Vasquez?"

"Decided he wanted to take a contract we signed in Sol Centura. Better money. Warmer weather." A shrug. "His loss. This is a good post."

"So I’ve heard." Lyria matched his pace. "The Katullins. Old money. Shipping and trade. Definitely not smuggling anything illegal."

"Definitely not." Niko’s smile was thin. "And we definitely don’t ask questions about the cargo manifests."

"Understood."

"Duty's straightforward. We keep the gilded cage gilded. The family plays their little political games; we make sure no one breaks the toys." He gestured toward the main house. "Abraxus runs everything. His son-in-law Lucius handles the books. Hermena is his daughter, she manages the household and the social front."

"Children?"

"Three." Easy enough. "The heir apparent, Rosalynn, fucked off to the Freelands two years ago. Don’t ask about it. It’s a sore subject." He paused for a moment as a cat shot across the path. "Lucius Jr. is young. Still learning the ropes from Abraxus. The family calls him Lucas to avoid confusion." 

Another pause. 

"And the middle one," his voice flattened, bored. "Penelope. She’s been falling apart since her sister left."

Lyria noted the pause and the flattening. Not long enough to call hesitation, but long enough to matter.

"Anything I should know about the family dynamics?"

"Stay out of them." Not a suggestion. "We’re employees. Well-paid and well-treated, but employees. The family’s internal politics aren’t our concern."

"Understood, Captain."

He showed her the grounds. Patrol routes. Security protocols. All standard and competent. Lyria followed, nodded, memorized. But the pause stuck. There was something there. Information deliberately withheld.

She noted it and kept walking.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W1 —————</h3>


The dining room seated twenty, but only five were present. Lyria stood near the wall, security-visible and unobtrusive. Her position gave her clean sightlines.

Abraxus Katullin sat at the head of the table, old and sharp-eyed with hands that clearly hadn’t done manual labor in decades, but still looked capable of violence. Lyria clocked it automatically. Don’t underestimate him.

Lucius and Hermena flanked him. Lucas sat next to his father, watching everything with a careful intensity. Cataloguing, learning, trying to impress. Standard heir procedure.

And across the table from him, sitting next to her mother, the middle one.

She was faekin, which was unusual for the family. Lyria had reviewed the files: no faekin lineage in the documented family tree until her and her sister. Bright red coloring, while her missing sister’s was silver. An anomaly. Noted for later.

Penelope’s eyes moved constantly, tracking conversations. Her smile appeared on cue. Laughter at the right moments. Right volume. Right duration.

Too right. The kind of right nervous performers used when following stage directions.

A half-second delay before each smile. Shoulders tight, never quite settling. Fingers tapping against the stem of her wine glass in an irregular rhythm. 

Penelope noticed the attention she was getting. Her gaze hardened just enough to register before smoothing again.

"Lieutenant Hale, is it?" Her voice was pleasant. Calibrated. "Welcome to the estate. I hope my grandfather’s security needs won’t bore you too terribly."

"I don’t bore easily, my lady."

"No?" A slight tilt of the head. Assessing back. "What interests you?"

"Puzzles," Lyria said. "Things that don’t quite fit."

Something slipped—an instant too late to blink, a fraction too long to hold eye contact—then the smile snapped back into place. Penelope turned to answer something her mother asked, dismissal clean and polite.

Lyria stayed still, watching. Niko was leaning against the wall behind Abraxus, posture loose, eyes fixed on her. Stop, the gaze said.

So that was it, then.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W2 —————</h3>


Lyria learned the rhythms of the estate quickly. Abraxus held meetings in his study each morning. Lucius kept to his office. Hermena rotated through social obligations. Lucas shadowed his grandfather.

And Penelope existed in the seams.

Meals. Functions. The occasional meeting where her presence was required. No clear role or obvious authority. Just… there. Abraxus kept her close.

Asset or liability, depending on how much she cost.

She disappeared for hours at a time. Mostly the library. Sometimes the wine cellars. Sometimes the gardens, late at night, hiding from something. And sometimes she headed toward the officers’ wing.

"The granddaughter," Lyria said casually during an evening briefing.

Niko’s quill paused. Then resumed. "What about her?"

"Just getting a read on the household." Lyria kept her tone neutral. "She seems… wound tight."

"She’s Abraxus’s granddaughter." Immediate. Defensive. "That’s all you need to know. Focus on your security protocols." 

"Understood, Captain."

Lyria didn’t push. She added it to the file instead.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">—————W3 —————</h3>


Lyria crossed the courtyard and heard raised voices.

Not loud. The Katullins didn’t do loud; they were sharp and controlled until they weren’t.

"—don’t need your concern, Grandfather—"

"What you need and what you want are rarely aligned, Penelope. I’m ensuring—"

"Ensuring what? That I perform adequately? That I don’t embarrass the family?"

"That you fulfill your obligations. As we all do."

Lyria kept walking, pace unchanged.

Penelope’s court voice had cracked and the real one had come out. It was rougher, less polished, no calibration. Family caused that.

She filed it away for later.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W4 —————</h3>


Lyria was doing her nightly perimeter check when she noticed Penelope crossing the courtyard and walking in the side door of the barracks like it was a normal routine.

Lyria followed silently, opened the door in time to see her knocking on the door fo the Captain’s private quarters. It opened. She slipped inside and the door shut hard behind her.

*That explains something.*

Lyria finished the route and logged the time as her mind supplied the obvious conclusions.

Penelope was the boss’s granddaughter. He was the captain of the guard. They were discreet, but not hidden. If Lyria noticed, Abraxus definitely had.

It seemed simple, on paper. Niko sold quiet; Penelope bought it. A transaction, repeated and effective, until it wasn’t. 

Arrangements had failure points. She noted the first one: the quiet never held.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W4 —————</h3>


"Your logs are very detailed."

Niko’s voice was neutral. Evening briefing, door shut. The briefing clearly wasn’t actually about patrol routes.

"They always are, Captain."

He didn’t look down at the papers. He watched her instead, like the pages were incidental. He leaned back against his desk.

"You’ve started writing about things that don’t belong in a security report."

Lyria kept her face blank. "Such as?"

"The granddaughter." He didn’t say her name.

Lyria didn’t flinch. "She’s part of the estate."

"She’s not part of your assignment." Niko’s mouth twitched, almost a smile. "Tell me what you’ve seen."

So this was a test. She paused for a moment.

"She goes to you when she can’t hold it together," Lyria carefully chose her words. "And she comes out held together."

Niko’s expression didn’t change, but his eyes sharpened.

"And?"

"And it doesn’t last," Lyria said. "Whatever you’re doing for her, it doesn’t last."

Niko stared at her for a long moment, then nodded once, as if confirming something he already knew.

"Good," he said. "So you understand what you’re looking at."

He stepped past her, opened the door.

"Now stop looking," his voice was mild; his eyes were anything but. "I don’t need you turning a private routine into a problem."

Lyria inclined her head. "Understood."

He nodded once. "Good. Now go write reports about something that won’t get you killed."

<h2>Month Two</h2>

Lyria was finishing the evening patrol when the door to the Captain’s personal quarters opened.

She slowed, then stepped into the alcove near the officers’ wing. Not hiding, but just enough off the main path to have a clean viewing angle.

Niko emerged, straightening his coat cuffs. He headed toward the main house without looking back.

Lyria waited. Thirty seconds. Forty-five seconds. The door opened again.

Penelope stepped out already composed. Shoulders straight, expression neutral, hair smoothed back into place.

She took one step, then stopped. Leaned against the doorframe for half a second, eyes closed, fingers curling into her palm before releasing. Her shoulders didn’t drop. Her breathing stayed measured, deliberate. She pushed away from the frame and started walking, two fingers tapping against her thigh in an irregular pattern.

Lyria had just turned to walk back further in the officers’ wing when the air changed, not with sound but with pressure.

Something dark red bloomed at her feet, like spilled wine soaking into a carpet. Then it moved. Vines of bright red threaded upward in a tight, deliberate pattern, curling around her boots and then her calves, climbing like ivy.

She attempted to move. Her legs didn’t answer her.

Lyria froze, breath hitching once before she forced it steady. She hadn’t layered spell defenses in days; she had assumed this place was tame enough to not need them. The sudden, absolute refusal of motion below the waist showed that was a mistake.

The red crept higher, ghosting up her knees, faintly luminous now with the suggestion of flowers. A threat dressed as decor. 

"Don’t bother testing it," Penelope’s voice was calm, controlled. "Announce yourself."

Lyria kept her hands visible. Slowly unclenched her fingers.

"Lieutenant Hale. On patrol."

Silence stretched. The pressure increased not with pain, just a certainty that she was stuck in place.

"You were standing in the shadows," Penelope said. Closer now. "Outside a private door. That makes you either careless or intentional."

The red tightened. Just a fraction. Enough to be unmistakable. 

"I recommend you be neither. Especially here."

Lyria swallowed. "Noted."

Another pause. Longer. Then the pressure eased, as if granting permission to allow her to move again. The red bled back into the stone, leaving grey behind as if it had never been there.

Penelope stepped into view at last, expression composed, eyes sharp.

"If you need to observe," she said, "do it where I can see you."

She inclined her head in a final manner and walked away.

Lyria waited until her legs remembered themselves.

Surprise didn't scare Penelope; it sharpened her and caused her to react.

*Interesting.*

She logged the time and resumed her patrol.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W7 —————</h3>


Lyria began paying closer attention to the patterns.

Penelope attended family dinners and social functions. Business meetings where her presence was required. She performed flawlessly—appropriate responses, calibrated smiles, timing precise enough to pass without comment.

The tells made themselves obvious once she knew where to look. The finger-tap rhythm to self-soothe. The fractional delay before each smile. The tension in her shoulders that never fully released.

Lyria started noticing the visits to Niko’s quarters. Not deliberately; her patrol route intersected the officers’ wing often enough that the pattern surfaced on its own, and she was trained to register deviations.

Every three to four days. Usually in the evening. Occasionally late. Sometimes brief. Sometimes long enough to count as punishment.

The outcome itself never changed; each time Penelope emerged composed and functional, still carrying the same underlying tension. No relief. No lasting shift. A consistent pattern with the same outcome every time.

Lyria logged it and moved on.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W8 —————</h3>


The next time Lyria noticed a variance was at a family dinner. Same position near the wall. Same sightlines she always used.

Penelope noticed. Made eye contact once before looking away.

Abraxus asked a question about estate logistics. She answered in Sylvan.

Lyria didn’t understand the words, but she noted the shift. The table followed Penelope without comment, conversation flowing smoothly into a language Lyria couldn’t enter. Her posture changed as she spoke it, just enough to register; shoulders easing, smile less delayed.

*She hides better here.*

Then Niko spoke. He’d been standing by the door, silent as the wallpaper. He caught Penelope’s eye and said something in Sylvan—low and measured. Penelope didn’t flinch, but the corners of her smile tightened. She replied something shorter and sharper. Niko’s brow furrowed.

After dinner, Lyria encountered her in the gardens while she was on her route. She was sitting on a concrete bench along the perimeter path, eyes unfocused as she stared at a rose bush. They snapped to her face as Lyria turned the corner.

"Lieutenant," Penelope said first. Polite. Composed. "May I trouble you for a moment?"

"Of course, my lady."

Penelope turned to face her fully. The garden lights caught the red of her eyes, steady and unreadable.

"You were watching the table tonight." A statement. Not accusation.

"On duty," Lyria said. "Yes."

Penelope looked at the ground and back up to her. "You weren’t just watching. Tell me what you saw."

"You changed the rules mid-meal," Lyria said.

Penelope’s smile tightened in something that looked like approval. "Go on."

Lyria considered her for a moment before answering. "The shift in language stood out."

Penelope smiled lightly. "I thought it might." No denial. No defensiveness. "It seemed appropriate. Family matters."

"Of course."

Silence stretched between them. Penelope’s eyes searched her face, assessing. Lyria waited.

"And?" Penelope asked. "What have else have you noticed?"

"I found seams," Lyria said. "I just haven’t found where you’re hiding the stitches."

Penelope’s expression didn’t change, but she was quiet for a moment.

"I’m asking this," she said at last, "because your continued attention to my routines could be misinterpreted. Not because your assessment is correct."

Clean. Reasonable. Boundaried. Her fingers tapped once against her skirt, then stilled.

"Understood," Lyria said.

Penelope inclined her head, formal and controlled.

"Then we’re clear," she said. "Good evening, Lieutenant."

She stood and walked back toward the house at a perfectly measured pace.

Lyria watched until the doors closed, then turned back to her route.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W8 —————</h3>


Lyria was finishing an equipment inventory when Niko stopped in the doorway.

"She came to me tonight," he said in greeting.

Lyria didn’t look up. "After dinner?"

He watched her for a moment, weighing whether that answer was coincidence or awareness. "After the gardens. She asked me something."

Lyria set the ledger down carefully. "What did she ask?"

"Whether she was failing."

The word hung there.

"And?" Lyria asked.

Niko didn’t answer immediately. He stepped farther into the room instead, leaning back against the table.

"I want to know what you would have said."

Lyria considered it briefly.

"I wouldn’t have reassured her," she said. "I would have told her that strain doesn’t show up all at once."

Niko’s expression stayed neutral. "Go on."

"That people don’t collapse," Lyria continued. "They thin. They adapt. And eventually something stops springing back."

"You would have confirmed it," he said.

"I would have *named* it," she replied. "That’s not the same thing."

Niko picked a dagger up from a crate and examined it.

"I told her she was fine," he said at last. Captain’s voice now. "That nothing was wrong. That she didn’t need to dwell on it."

"Did that end the conversation?" Lyria asked.

"That’s not your concern."

Lyria nodded once. "She’s compensating."

Niko’s gaze sharpened. "She’s surviving," he corrected.

"Those aren’t interchangeable," Lyria said.

Silence stretched.

"Lyria." Not rank. Name. "I didn’t put you here because you’re gentle. You notice pressure points. You understand how things fail. That’s useful." His eyes hardened. "It’s also dangerous."
He stepped closer. Familiar distance. His hand closed around her wrist. Not painful, not kind, but certain.

"You don’t get to decide what she is. You don’t get to fix her, and you don’t get to change how she functions." His gaze held hers. "Not yet."

Lyria met his gaze, but didn’t pull away.

"Understood," she said.

He released her wrist and stepped back, then turned and left without further comment. Lyria stood where she was.

That was the rule, then. She could observe, log, recognize failure when she saw it.

But containment and intervention still belonged to him.

<h2>Month Three</h2>

The visits to Niko's quarters increased steadily. Every other night. Sometimes two nights running. 

Lyria logged them the same way she logged patrol schedules, noting duration and frequency. Thirty to forty-five minutes, consistent. What changed wasn’t the schedule.  

It was the aftermath.

Penelope returned to the house quieter than before. Not calmer. Just… tighter. The mask set faster. The recovery window was shorter. The tells she’d learned to watch for surfaced sooner and vanished more abruptly, like something being forced back into place before it was ready.

Distance didn’t obscure that.

She noted it and moved on, unsure what the pattern meant yet.

<h2>Month Four</h2>

Penelope started appearing more often. Library, gardens, corridors at odd hours. Always with plausible reasons—looking for a book, taking air, on her way somewhere else. But the frequency was wrong.

Lyria tracked it: eight initiated contacts in two weeks. Previous baseline: twice a month, always reactive.

Deliberate pattern change.

One evening in the library, Penelope closed the door behind her.

"What else have you observed?" Direct. No social preamble.

"About?" Lyria set down her security report.

"About me. You're always watching." Penelope moved closer. "So what else have you seen that no one else does?"

*She wants an assessment.*

Lyria weighed the tactic. Deflection was useless; the woman had been trained from childhood to smell a lie before it was fully formed.

"You switch languages before anyone asks you something you don’t want to answer." Lyria said. "Not defensive, exactly. More like a control mechanism."

Penelope's breath caught. Small sound, quickly stifled.

"What else?"

"You're visiting Niko more frequently but it's not—" she reflected on the phrasing. "The baseline tension returns faster afterward. Each time."

"You're dissecting me." Penelope's voice was steady but her breathing had changed. Shallow. Faster.

"Yes." No point denying it.

"Do you *enjoy* it?" Penelope asked. "Breaking me down into pieces you can write in a report?"

Lyria paused. Contemplated the best answer. Decided on honesty again. 

"Yes," she said finally. "I like knowing how things work. Especially things that aren't supposed to."

"That's awful."

"Probably." Lyria held her gaze. "But you're here asking for the assessment anyway."

Penelope stared at her, something raw flickering in her expression that Lyria catalogued but couldn't quite interpret. Then she turned and left, composure cracking at the edges, pace just slightly too fast.

Lyria sat alone in the empty library. Penelope wanted honesty, and she got it. 

It had terrified her.

But she hadn’t told Lyria to stop.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W14 —————</h3>


After that, it got harder to pretend she wasn’t noticing.

Lyria didn’t go looking for anything; she didn’t have to. The officers’ wing carried sound whether you wanted it to or not, and some nights the quiet just didn’t come back the way it was supposed to.

Penelope left Niko’s quarters tighter than before. The mask went on fast, but it slipped sooner. The tells Lyria had learned to watch for appeared earlier and were suppressed more aggressively, like they were being forced back into place instead of allowed to settle.

Lyria recorded what would survive scrutiny. Entry time. Exit time. How long Penelope stood still before moving again. She did not record why it was happening.

One night she caught Sylvan through the wall. Itwasn’t the words—it was the cadence. Too fast. Uneven in places where it used to flow clean. Niko answered in clipped phrases, all control, no give.

Then the door. Footsteps leaving.

Lyria stayed awake longer than necessary, listening to the wing reset itself. Whatever Penelope was trying to say, it wasn’t being understood.

Lyria filed that away as a pressure point she wasn’t ready to touch yet.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">————— W15 —————</h3>


"She’s getting worse."

Niko fell into step beside her without warning, like he was commenting on the weather.

"She’s changing," Lyria agreed.

"She’s unraveling," he replied. "And whatever was keeping it neat isn’t doing that anymore."

That was new. Lyria slowed. He didn’t.

"You told me not to interfere," she said.

"I told you not to make things obvious. You haven’t." His eyes flicked sharply to her, measuring. She waited.

"She’s holding it together in public," Niko went on. "Barely. At night, she comes apart faster than she used to. The quiet doesn’t last. The reassurance doesn't work."

Lyria said nothing. Let him finish.

"You were right about one thing. Letting it sit doesn’t make it smaller." The admission landed without ceremony.

"So what now?" Lyria asked.

Niko stopped walking. "Now you stop pretending you’re only watching." He turned fully toward her. "You notice the cracks before anyone else does. You know where pressure breaks instead of bends. That’s why you’re here."

Lyria looked at him, calculating.

"With what limits?" Lyria asked.

His mouth twitched. Not a smile.

"Don’t make it public. Don’t make it permanent. And don’t make me regret handing this to you."

He stepped past her. "Handle it, Lieutenant. However you think is cleanest."

He kept walking. Lyria stood where she was, contemplating.

This wasn’t trust. It was delegation.

And it meant containment had just become her responsibility.
